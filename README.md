Crack extension based on [cracklib](https://github.com/cracklib/cracklib) 
for PHP 5.x. This version of PHP has been discontinued for a long time and 
should not be used anymore in production (I doubt that it could compile in any 
modern Linux, for instance), but the extension could give you some ideas on how 
to use [cracklib](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/postlfs/cracklib.html)
for password validation.
