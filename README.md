Extension for PHP 5.x, based on [cracklib](https://github.com/cracklib/cracklib). This 
version of PHP has been discontinued for a long time and should not be used 
in production anymore (I doubt that it could compile in any modern Linux, anyway), 
but the extension could give you some ideas on how to use 
[cracklib](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/postlfs/cracklib.html)
for password validation.
